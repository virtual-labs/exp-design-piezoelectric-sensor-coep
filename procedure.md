### Basic Knowledge 
- Answer all the questions and click on "Submit Test" button

### Configuration
- Select the material
- Select length, thickness, width of material and configure 
- Click on "Next Level"

### Calculations
- Enter the force between 1 to 50 (N)
- Calculate pressure and enter it's value. If the value is correct, further calculations will be enabled and if the value is incorrect, then formula followed by correct answer will be displayed after 3 attempts
- Calculate output voltage and enter it's value, if the value is correct, further calculations will be enabled and if the value is incorrect, then the formula followed by correct answer will be displayed after 3 attempts
- Calculate charge Q. After calculating correct answer click on "Next Reading" button and similarly calculate other 4 readings for the same material
- After calculating 5 readings, select another material from the top and repeat the same process by selecting another material
- After recording 5 readings for the new material, click the "Compare with Previous Material" button

### Standard observations
- Here, you can compare the difference between the standard calculations for both materials
- Click "Next Level" at the top

### Actual observations
- Here, you can find the difference between standard values and observed values for both the materials
- Click "Next Level" at the top

### Testing
- Select the material for testing
- Select appropriate dimensions i.e length, width and height and click on check configuration
- If the selected parameters are correct, the Height and Weight fields will be enabled, while the remaining configuration parameters above will be disabled
- Enter a height between 1 and 100 cm, input the appropriate weight, and click "Start". You will then see the force required on digital meter
- Click on "Reset" button and take trials for different height and weight
- If the sensor breaks due to certain parameters, click the "Reselect" button to adjust the configuration and repeat the process, taking different trials. After recording 5 readings, you can proceed to the next level's results page
