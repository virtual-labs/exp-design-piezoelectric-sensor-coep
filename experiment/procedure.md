### Configuration :
- Select the material.
- Select Length, Thickness, Width of material and configure. 
- Click on Next Level.

### Calculations : 
- Enter the Force between 1 to 50 (N).
- Calculate pressure and enter it's value if the value is correct further calculations will be enabled and if the value is Incorrect then formula followed by correct answer will be displayed after 3 attempts.
- Calculate output voltage and enter it's value, if the value is correct further calculations will be enabled and if the value is Incorrect then formula followed by correct answer will be displayed after 3 attempts.
- Calculate Charge Q, same process is repeated as above.
- Click on Next Reading. Similar calculations can be done with different forces for same material.
- Once 5 Calculations are completed, click on select another material and Select another material. - Repeat the same calculations for another material and calculate 5 Readings.
- After Completing the calculation for both the materials, Click on compare with previous material as this will show observations with graph for both the materials.
